This E-Commerce Data Analytics project explores an e-commerce dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. Using Python and tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the project applies data cleaning, exploratory analysis, time series analysis, and customer segmentation to turn raw data into actionable insights. Key findings can help businesses optimize marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and manage inventory more effectively.
